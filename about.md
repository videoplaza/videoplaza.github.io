Videoplaza, an Ooyala company, empowers broadcasters and video publishers to build profitable and sustainable businesses in the internet-delivered TV world. And yes, we are [hiring!] [careers]
</p>

Videoplazaâ€™s video ad serving platform, Karbon, monetises video experiences across PCs, mobile devices, tablets, game consoles, IPTV, Smart TV and HBBTV. We help publishers and broadcasters manage, sell, optimise yield and deliver video advertising across all these environments. Our Stockholm office is the hub for all R&D and has an international feel with colleagues from 16+ countries.

Videoplaza was acquired by Ooyala in October 2014. Ooyala, a subsidiary of Telstra Corporation Limited, delivers personalized video experiences across all screens and is a leader in online video management, publishing, analytics and monetization. Headquartered in Silicon Valley, Ooyala has offices in New York City, London, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and Guadalajara, Mexico.

Scaling our platform to handle tens of thousands of req/s with zero downtime, providing real time reports and forecasts based on billions of log rows and building a simple and intuitive UI that lets our clients easily traffic their advertisement campaigns and maximize their sales; these are some of the complex challenges that make development work at Videoplaza interesting and rewarding (did I mention that we're [hiring?] [careers]).
